# Can't Forget To

This is a todo list app I built using Angular and the Angular Material library.  It is pretty simple and stores your todo list in local storage.  Once you add a todo to your list you will have two actions on you can perform on that todo which are complete and delete. If you complete a todo, it will be greyed out with a line through it and the complete action will disappear but you still have the ability to delete it.  

You can use the app at here:
